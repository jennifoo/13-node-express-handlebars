## Functionality

* Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the name of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page with a button titled "Devour It" which allows the user to devour the burger.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
